## How versions are handled
`version="1.3.16"`
- "16" is for minor changes/additions that are fully backwards-compatible (like adding a new attribute which doesn't affect anything else)
- "3" is for changes/additions which aren't backwards-compatible (like completely replacing a attribute)
- "1" is the major version, only changed for major rewrites to the system (so likely never)
